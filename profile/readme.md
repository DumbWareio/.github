# DumbWare

Welcome to **DumbWare**! 🚀

We build apps that are smart enough to be useful, but just dumb enough to keep things fun. Whether you're here to explore, contribute, or just accidentally clicked the wrong link, you're in the right place.

## 📦 Our Stuff
We have 7 (or maybe 8?) apps—who's counting? Each one does something cool (or dumb). They're all part of the DumbWare ecosystem, powered by Node.js, Express, and a sprinkle of JavaScript magic. Plus, you can run them all at once with Docker!

## 🐳 Running Everything at Once
Just want everything?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DumbWareio/DumbCompose.git
cd DumbCompose
docker-compose up
```

Boom. You're in. 💥
